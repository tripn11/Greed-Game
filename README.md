# Greed-Game
This game can be played by two players.
The objective is to get to the preset score before the opponent.
When a player rolls the dice, his score is recorded but not saved as Total Score above.
A player can roll as much as he/she wants but the score would only saved when he hits the "Hold" button. After which it would be the next players turn.
The catch is that when a player rolls "1". Then he loses all his score for the round. Then forcefully loses the round to the opponent.
Also, rolling two sixes in a row means the player will lose everything even the total score saved.
Lastly, the target score must be set before the game begins.
